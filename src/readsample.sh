a man made plain,<br />

asphalt plane --<br />

surface: plain,<br />

oil-stained;<br />

concrete, crushed up in pitch/tar;<br />

black as obsidian, pitch dark --<br />

except where, in yellow, marked:<br />

HHHHH HHHHH<br />

HHHHH HHHHH<br />

A long, white cargo van,<br />
windowless in the back,<br />
is there, parked;<br />
behind its windshield<br />
a flint briefly sparks,<br />
illuminates a familiar face,<br />
here, in an unfamiliar place,<br />
in another time,<br />
is where we find<br />
Hannah<br />
and her man<br />
in the front seat of his van,<br />
drinking cheap beer with a ribbon on the can<br />
like it's a prize.<br />

After<br />
a hash brown dinner scattered,<br />
smothered in cheese, covered in onions, and chunked with ham,<br />
they wound up here, in Bumfuck, Japan,<br />
to her surprise.<br />
Tonight, it’s hot outside --<br />
the seat’s vinyl sticks to Hannah’s thighs;<br />
in the moonlight, sweat on her skin shines<br />
like silver, anodized.<br />
And now Hannah tries<br />
the radio...<br />
She’s reminded emphatically that the year is 1981 --<br />
nothing good, tonight, on the radio, hon;<br />
and there won’t be anywhere under the sun<br />
until roughly 1991 -- no kidding, not one.<br />
They’ve been here since eight;<br />
now it’s late<br />
because they had to wait<br />
to be found by a lucky Penny...<br />
as golden as she is copper,<br />
as what Penny has to offer<br />
is a literal heart stopper.<br />
To most folks,<br />
it’s worth at least its weight in gold,<br />
and in 1981, about twice that, is for what it’s sold.<br />
Seth tells Hannah not to worry,<br />
yet again.<br />

How many times now?<br />
Five? Ten?<br />
This time he clues her in<br />
that his friend,<br />
Penny Sinn,<br />
happens to be an RN<br />
so it’s “totally safe”.<br />
Seth explains,<br />
“We’ll be in the qualified hands<br />
of a registered nurse...<br />
it doesn’t even hurt<br />
when administered by an expert.”<br />

14<br />
Penny Sinn<br />
is in<br />
the back of the van, just behind them;<br />
Seth called earlier from a pay phone,<br />
and gave directions so she could find them.<br />
Penny is sitting on a five-gallon bucket --<br />
fuck it,<br />
it’s a “bucket seat” --<br />
she doesn't mind<br />
that it’s all she could find<br />
among the power tools,<br />
sheet rock, and chunks of concrete.<br />
Penny is a busty redhead --<br />
voluptuous, it’s been said,<br />
though she’s not as pretty as Hannah.<br />
“T & A”<br />
for days and days,<br />
and in the back,<br />
"A" crack<br />
flossed with pink thong panties<br />
that split<br />
into a “Y” above<br />
Daisy Duke shorts that fit<br />
like a glove,<br />
they rise low but are high cut<br />
so that plenty<br />
of Penny’s<br />
butt<br />
sticks out the bottom.<br />
Penny shakes<br />
that “A” to make<br />
dollars leave pockets<br />
as sure as leaves fall in autumn...<br />
To be clear,<br />
Penny is an exotic dancer, i.e., a stripper...<br />
and also an escort, and a drug dealer,<br />
among many other things<br />
(hell, in the shower, she’s been known to sing).<br />
But a nurse, Penny certainly is not --<br />
this is something Seth, on the spot,<br />
just now, thought<br />
up,<br />
hoping Hannah would be<br />
down<br />
to move<br />
forward<br />
instead of holding<br />
back<br />
with trepidation<br />
in<br />
hesitation<br />
about trying<br />
out<br />
this risky route<br />
of administration,<br />
on this obviously not-so-special occasion.<br />

15<br />
Seth’s lie<br />
should be recognized<br />
as a manipulative device<br />
that’s based on a classic<br />
drug addict<br />
rationalization:<br />
“As Long As She’s Getting High,<br />
So Can I”<br />
In Seth's own words, as told to Jose,<br />
his employee and captive audience of one:<br />
"When I want to get high --<br />
'Honey, here’s something you should try…'<br />
and if she likes it,<br />
that’s perfect for my scheme --<br />
we’ll get high as a team<br />
so I won’t feel so much like a fiend.<br />
I don’t want anyone around who’s sober and clean,<br />
or even just refraining<br />
from the drug I’m taking,<br />
reminding me that I’m<br />
‘fucking up’,<br />
warning me when I’ve<br />
'had enough',<br />
making me aware
of unconscious self-deception,
sandbagging me
with unwelcome introspection,
haunting me with, in the mirror,
my own reflection;
so... I’ll use the tried and true
art of suggestion
to get her to try
the drugs that I buy...
this great new high...
just this one time...
just this one line...
all will be fine...
here, babe,
have some of mine...
and soon after,
as fate would have it,
the habit:
she has it
‘poof’, like magic
she shares, with me, this tragic
imperfection;
guilty of the same stigmatic
transgression,
now how can she, my bad habit, question?"
This concludes the lesson.
Let's move on.

16

Penny’s preparation

and administration

of tonight’s medication

requires just basic sterilization --

there doesn’t really need to be a nurse,

and anyhow,

Penny is rather well-versed.

Everything needed is kept in her purse.

She pulls out a glass vial,

all the while

all smiles

for miles

and miles --

that’s just her style.

Inside is a gram of AAA grade cocaine, HCl...

fresh off-the-brick,

sticky as shit

with a pungent smell --

it’s the only kind Penny ever sells.

Into a syringe, draws up from a bottle,

till filled,

H2O, distilled;

when, with H2O, it’s covered,

the chunk of HCl

melts as smooth as warm butter,

dissolves flawlessly

into the other.

By muscle memory,

her fingers reach for a Marlb*ro

Cowboy Killer --

with her teeth, Penny

gently

slides out the white cottony

filter --

breaks off a piece,

throws it in the vial;

draws up through it evenly the solution,

into, lined yp single file,

seven rigs,

then puts back together her cig

and smiles real big...

"Who’s first up, kids?"

Then it's:

"All aboard!"

She is a clever one.

17

Hannah tries to lose her frown,

considers qualms no more,

as she dutifully climbs down

out of the passenger side door.

She’s not brave, she's being complicit;

generally, what Seth says,

she goes along with it.

As she starts walking

along the side of the van to the back,

Hannah knows she’s being played --

of course, she's aware of that --

not oblivious

to this

manipulative act;

still, she knows her place

in his space,

so she knows not to react.

She slightly closes her eyes,

and tries to visualize

the stigmatized

the ritualized

exercise

of incremental suicide

approaching fast on the horizon --

this sublime

yet forbidden high,

for the first time,

she’s about to try.

Hannah is, admittedly, excited,

but in an uneasy way;

not necessarily enthusiastic...

it’s just the last thing she thought she’d try today.

Seth says it is fantastic --

she is curious, as anyone would be,

but not all that sure that she should be.

She can’t help feeling coerced;

she’d like to have more time to consider it first...

Now, in the back of the van,

Penny says, "Hannah, try to relax..."

as she ties on a tourniquet.

She gives Hannah’s arm a smack

till it’s a little red.

Then says,

"Taking the drug via this route

will no doubt

ring your ears right out.

As soon as I take the needle out,

you’re going to hear that train

coming fast

down the tracks...

remember, if you can,

to step out of the van

in case you’re going to yak --

but the nausea probably won’t last,

it tends to, without incident, pass."

Penny continues,

"When I stick the needle in you,

try not to freak out

and when we're done, try not to geek-out...

I'm kidding -- but seriously, chill out;

you probably aren’t going to die,

last thing you want to do

is ruin your high

on your first try --

after all, this hit will always be the best,

against which you will judge all the rest."

Penny wraps her little speech up

by picking the rig up,

"So... all that's asked

is that you just try to relax --

after the shot, fuck that,

get up off your ass!

Stand up, walk around,

listen to the subtle glisten

that sounds like bending sheet metal

or shattering glass,

as blood rushes fast,

the inner ear, past.

Try to be in the moment,

enjoy the blast,

because, long enough, the rush won’t last;

for this reason, it’s true

one’s first hit is rarely her last."

18

Hannah isn’t really sure

what Penny is talking about

as she feels the needle puncture her skin

and watches blood flash into the syringe;

until, from her arm,

Penny takes out the point

and suddenly it’s clear as a bell.

She hears a steam whistle loud as hell,

and can feel the train’s engine...

CHUG-CHUGGA-CHUG-CHUGGA

CHUG-CHUGGA-CHUG-CHUGGA

CHUG-CHUGGA-CHUG-CHUGGA

CHUG-CHUGGA-CHUG-CHUGGA

It's getting stronger fast

as it comes speeding down the tracks.

Hannah’s eyes are open wide,

round as half dollar coins --

so big, damn near joined.

Her posture is suddenly stiff,

her movements jerky and fast,

as if someone walked up from behind

and stuck a popsicle up her ass...

Penny is watching her

and can’t stop laughing --

her laughter,

and any other chatter,

sounds as if run through a flanger, a phaser,

or a ring modulator.

It's tinged with high pitched harmonics

like when glass shatters,

or like a tin roof in the wind,

as it slowly bends.

The laughter echoes...

phase shifts in tremolo...

as if, with an LFO, modulated.

And there’s a dizzying wave of vertigo

with the laughter, syncopated...

the laughter echoes,

and the echoes echo,

and the echo’s echoes echo...

Ringing laughter, monophonic, via infinite regress,

becomes polyphonic -

an aural illusion, hypnotically euphonic

collides

with a rush that words fail to describe,

as her voice,

almost a whisper, she tries

to find.

These sensations combine

to nearly, literally, blow the mind;

she’s done coke before,

but this is quite another high,

like taking a different drug.

CHUG-CHUGGA-CHUG

“Intense” doesn’t do it justice,

the rush is indulgent, hedonic,

pseudo-erotic,

rather chaotic,

and as it sometimes happens, mildly psychotic;

nothing short of quite literally insane.

It feels like that train

has driven straight through her brain

and is dragging her body along on the tracks below --

run down by heavy machinery while in the throes

of hypersonic sensory overload.

She fears both her heart and her head could combust spontaneously,

and suddenly explode simultaneously…

The prominent aural dimension

enthralls her attention --

the ringing, the vertigo --

and the rush is, indeed, the best there is.

But it's intense

to an extent

that causes fear.

Hannah decides right here,

right now:

it’s just not to her liking,

somehow.

She thinks it’s just way too frightening...

and how!

There is something unnerving

about a high that takes away one's breath

by bringing them, quite literally,

to the brink of death.

No sense in using words, euphemistic --

it feels fucking cataclysmic.

Hannah says she will stick to buzzes

a little less apocalyptic...

Not exactly the result Seth was looking for,

now, is it?

Seth doesn’t tell her that her fears are well-founded

and anything but unique,

when, about it,

the two of them, soon after, speak;

Seth knows heroin addicts

with ten-year habits

who just won’t have it --

“Shoot coke man why?

It’s been years since I tried...

makes me feel like I’m going to die every time.”

It’s certainly not for everyone...

But there are some, like Seth, for example,

who try that first sample,

and forever after, just can’t get enough

of that rush...

The fear is appropriate,

the danger is quite real,

if you’re not taking care,

your life, suddenly, it can steal.

Your heart, it can stop beating in your chest

in just a couple minutes or less.

If you've taken too much,

as soon as you remove the needle from your arm

you will know death is eminent;

you've never felt such alarm.

And then you have maybe a minute or so

before you fall out; down you go,

onto the floor, and you convulse...

then for good, you turn blue and lose your pulse.

This, too many have the misfortune to discover --

to name just a few:

Bel*shi, F*rley, Phoen*x, Ho*n;

these men all died from putting cocaine in their spoon.

19

After Seth and Penny take their shots,

Penny hands the rest of the rigs to Seth,

and then hands him a folded dollar.

She then clears out;

never one to linger about...

For a while longer,

Seth and Hannah hang out in the lot.

To his dismay,

when Seth hits another shot,

Hannah passes,

doesn't give it another thought…

eventually they smoke a joint

as the crash

slowly moves past.

For Hannah,

the dysphoria is almost as intense as the blast;

the hours long malaise,

for days,

seems to last.

For Seth,

packed inside the dollar,

what, from Penny, he bought

makes the high taper off

so that the comedown is naught --

but because his plan

didn’t work out like it ought,

his ears are still a little hot,

so share it with Hannah, he does not.

And before they leave the lot,

an argument ensues,

with Hannah finally asking Seth

about the big red elephant in the room:

"How do you know her?

Is she really 'only an old friend'?

Just who, again,

is Penny Sinn?

I don’t believe she’s an RN...

An RN, that’s a laugh.

Is your Penny Sinn anyone else

you didn’t yet tell me about?"

She looks like a prostitute, more --

like a dime store

whore.

Was your Penny Sinn that stripper

I saw on your lap at the club once before?

How many times, again,

was your penis in Penny Sinn?"

This is the first time Seth hits Hannah --

could have been, she was hit with a bolt of lightning

as they sat in the van fighting.

Open handed, hard as hell, across her face...

WHACK!

Out of fucking nowhere; it happened that fast.

Seth tells Hannah she was out of place to ask,

but now there’s no taking it back...

next time she won’t just get slapped,

she had better believe that.

She needs to watch her fucking mouth...

he would have a right mind to throw her out,

then a ride she’d be without,

in BFJ

totally assed out….

20

Hannah doesn’t make a sound,

not a peep;

just frowns,

and keeps

looking down

at her feet

on the floor...

not a sound

as tears pour

creep

down,

streak

her round

cheeks...

not a sound

as her heart sinks

down,

` to the van's floorboard.

It beats

hardly

anymore,

just hurts horribly

ever more.

Hannah begins to recognize

a situation that she knows all too well...

she knows what to expect,

being no stranger to this part of Hell.

She knows what’s coming next,

all of this is redolent of her very first time.

She just waits in silence;

ever compliant.

This isn't rocket science.

Her life experience has made it apparent

that violence shares a parent

with sexual defilement;

she knows this man

intends to claim his entitlement.

Not a word

forms on Hannah’s lips,

even as Seth unbuttons, unzips,

and yanks her shorts down her hips.

Hannah’s back is now almost flat on the seat,

as her ass has been dragged a couple of feet.

Her bra is twisted up her chest,

and her right elbow is now above her head,

still leaning on the passenger door arm rest.

On the windshield, press her bare feet;

her legs are out-splayed

in the shape

of a

V

as her knees

nearly scrape the ceiling.

Seth is between her legs,

at the seat's edge,

nearly kneeling,

stroking his cock,

his pants down, peeling.

The night,

Hannah's not too much feeling;

her mind is somewhere else,

far away,

gently reeling.

Learned in the aftermath of previous encounters,

a tactic with which Hannah now experiments,

self-hypnosis,

reduces the impact of the experience.

Ideally, it’s accomplished via ceiling fan,

but here, she stares at a blood spot

on the ceiling of the van;

likely, it sprayed out of a shot

by accident,

and then by Seth, got

forgot.

And now, as Hannah's staring at the spot,

her vision blurs

and she goes into a trance

just as Seth is removing her underpants

her consciousness goes elsewhere,

on a brief vacation,

with her external awareness

tuned to a white noise station.

Seth grips her a sec

by her neck

and from beneath her arm pit,

lifts her a bit.

And down on them, the moonlight shines

as he pulls the seatbelt out from behind,

and it hisses,

as, all the way, it unwinds...

HISSSS... SSS... SSS... SSS... CLANK!

Once it's unwound

her body is bound

as he holds it tight across her chest,

and lets her weight finally rest.

The waist strap digs down hard into her breasts,

tight enough so that her circulation is suppressed.

CLICK-CLACK!

Just like that,

The seatbelt's snapped,

and with the waist strap,

she's now truly trapped --

pinned tightly to the seat

with, still on the windshield, her feet.

And then he twists the shoulder strap,

then wraps, and wraps...

and wraps...

all of the seatbelt's slack

around her neck.

He then smiles, pleased with the effect --

his "fuck puppet", prepped

for autoerotic asphyxiation

via automotive bondage.

Any effort to resist now will be, by Seth, easily truncated,

strapped down as she is, with her defenses abated,

in this empty parking lot, where potential witnesses are evaded,

and for Seth's needs, perfectly situated.

Seth pulls from the van's console two of the rigs.

He has no trouble hitting himself; in a few seconds, he’s a stuck pig.

More challenging is hitting Hannah with his hands shaking,

after the first shot, taking.

He manages to get the needle into a vein at the crook of her elbow;

the spot at which, when drawing blood, nurses will go.

Hannah is in her meditation space still, though,

so she doesn't fight it --

she is submissive, with eyes closed, and real quiet.

Not as popular as fight or flight

is this third option: freeze...

perfectly still and seemingly at peace,

completely unalarmed,

she freezes, as to minimize harm.

Thus, barely on her radar is the needle in her arm;

she is oblivious to this violence.

There is only silence...

And then she hears a steam whistle,

as her head blows out, and the train

is coming fast, again.

She has an urge to stand up because of the rush from this stimulant,

and because nausea hits her in a tidal wave.

That and she just really wants to get the hell off of the track;

that fucking train is coming fast...

CHUG-CHUGGA-CHUG-CHUGGA

CLACK-CLICK-CLACK

But Hannah's going nowhere fast...

the seat belt's buckle is chest-level and just behind her back,

her shorts are twisted around one ankle,

and Seth's now putting her legs over his shoulders.

There is plenty, in her place, to hold her,

none of it subtle

and no way can she get to that buckle.

Meanwhile, Seth is looking aloof; he casually cracks his knuckles...

Then, out of nowhere --

well, out of cruelty --

Seth slaps her again,

hard as all fuck;

so hard her vision doubles up,

and after a flash of light,

everything starts to spin

as Seth forces his way in.

After that every time the seat rocks

the seat belt seems to be tightening,

making the way her heart is racing from the shot

ever more frightening.

Hannah remains idle

as her bare ass scrapes back and forth against the vinyl.

Fat tears continue to roll down her cheeks,

but her silence is final.

Only the front bench seat

beneath her speaks

up;

not with protests or appeals,

but with squeaks

and

tortured squeals,

like those of baby milk-fed veal.

As the seat rocks back and forth,

any remaining silence, it steals;

it barks loudly

like a drunken, mezzo soprano seal.

As Seth moves aggressively against her

the metal bottom of the front bench that seats them

tries and fails

to slide and wails

beneath them,

along the track

ordinarily that

adjusts where you're at

once you've sat.

As Seth starts moaning and groaning,

the obnoxious seat is now caterwauling

like some maniacal menagerie of wild misfit monkeys in heat,

desperately calling for lubrication --

WD-40, that is.

Not the monkeys, the seat.

From the noisy, chaotic ambience,

an off-beat rhythm eventually congeals;

in discordant harmony, then, from the dissonance,

a meandering melody, itself, reveals.

The cacophonous soundtrack the seat sings

all but steals the macabre and menacing

scene

we are witnessing.

All of this sound with a certain, familiar spectral tinge;

this time around, Hannah can only close her eyes and cringe.

And there’s no hope of conjuring up the meditative trance;

a moment ago was her only chance.

Seth sure seems to be enjoying himself, though.

He grabs a fistful of her hair,

so that her head is ensnared,

and holds it steady there

so it won’t bounce around everywhere.

And then, without stopping

he strikes her again,

and then one more again --

with the back hand,

on it, a jagged ring.

Oh wow...

Damn. That's gotta sting.

And how!

Finally, she cries out --

really belts one out;

and as she shouts,

Seth pulls tight the shoulder strap,

and chokes the end of the note

right out of her throat,

as tears pour out of her eyes

and he moves deeper into her between her thighs.

He tightens up the seat belt even more, some,

till her eyes bulge, all bloodshot, and her face goes numb.

He continues to rape her till the moment he comes,

at which point he finally taps the seatbelt release

just as he... releases;

and so does she,

reflexively,

an unsolicited climax

at the climax

of near asphyxia...

Now Hannah is gasping air --

huge breaths, in and out, deep --

as well, chokes, coughs and gags,

as out of her eyes pour tears and she finally, audibly, weeps.

Incidentally, if we closely listen up...

the front bench seat has finally shut up.

21

For years after, she is haunted;

recurring in her mind

is this retrospective...

this night, this violence

to which she was subjected,

and how, the next day, with her silence,

this treatment, she accepted,

as with her continued presence,

she did not reject it.

Her future,

’twas thusly trajected;

by this curse, to be affected;

going forward, forever infected.

After this night, such treatment fast becomes the norm,

and stays that way even as all her kids are born;

over the years,

from here,

it gets exponentially more severe.

Seth, she learns to fear.

She both goes to sleep and wakes up in tears.

She feels forever stuck right here,

on this night, in the seatbelt, ensnared,

with his left hand clutching a fistful of her hair...

A coerced masochist,

this former high school nympholept became;

she feels she deserves this,

her head hangs in shame.

She brought it upon herself,

who else

could she blame?

No one told her differently

so it became her self-fulfilling prophecy.

On this night, these tears are merely the first tears shed --

in coming years she’ll mourn the young woman, as of tonight, dead.

The young woman she was

before

this poison, she was fed;

before

broken ribs, she’d borne;

before

scarred her skin, his scorn;

before

this crown of thorns,

her head, adorned;

that has, over years, through her,

its way torn.

No matter how bright

the morning’s sunlight rays,

they never again light

up her days.

Tragically,

this is the way it stays;

things are never again going to be OK.

Damn...

I don't know about everyone else,

but I'm about ready to get the hell out of BFJ.
